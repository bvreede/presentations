# 4.1 Directed Networks


- Edge goes _from_ source node _to_ target node

- Each node has a degree
  - in-degree: number of incoming links
  - out-degree: number of outgoing links
  
--

- Observed in information networks, such as:
  - email
  - wikipedia
  - journal publications

# 4.2 The web

#### The world wide web as an information network:
- **Node**: anything with a URL
- **Edge**: link to a URL (directed)

--

#### Browser and server communicate through HTTP protocol:
- _Client_ sends URL (e.g. host.npr.org)
- _DNS_ returns IP (e.g. 216.35.221.76)
- _Client_ sends request (e.g.)
  ```
  GET / HTTP/1.1
  Host: npr.org
  ```
- _Server_ returns content (e.g.)
  ```
  HTTP 1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: text/html
  
  <HTML>
  <HEAD>
  <Title>National Public Radio</Title>
  ...
  </HTML>
  ```

# Web crawler

.pull-left[
#### Breadth-first search algorithm running on the Web link graph

- Starts from (high-quality/relevant) seed pages
- Recursively extracts links and adds them to 'frontier'
- Technically challenging, but conceptually simple


#### The frontier:

- First in, first out
- Pages at distance _n-1_ before those at distance _n_
- Thus: high initial relevance to seed
- Often optimized, revisit known pages

# Web structure and size

**Web graph**: the network of Web pages and hyperlinks

- Many (weakly) connected components
- Skewed size distribution
