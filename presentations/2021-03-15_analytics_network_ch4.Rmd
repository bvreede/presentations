# 4.1 Directed Networks


- Edge goes _from_ source node _to_ target node

- Each node has a degree
  - in-degree: number of incoming links
  - out-degree: number of outgoing links
  
--

- Observed in information networks, such as:
  - email
  - wikipedia
  - journal publications

# 4.2 The web

#### The world wide web as an information network:
- **Node**: anything with a URL
- **Edge**: link to a URL (directed)

--

#### Browser and server communicate through HTTP protocol:
- _Client_ sends URL (e.g. host.npr.org)
- _DNS_ returns IP (e.g. 216.35.221.76)
- _Client_ sends request (e.g.)
  ```
  GET / HTTP/1.1
  Host: npr.org
  ```
- _Server_ returns content (e.g.)
  ```
  HTTP 1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: text/html
  
  <HTML>
  <HEAD>
  <Title>National Public Radio</Title>
  ...
  </HTML>
  ```

# Web crawler

.pull-left[
#### Breadth-first search algorithm running on the Web link graph

- Starts from (high-quality/relevant) seed pages
- Recursively extracts links and adds them to 'frontier'
- Technically challenging, but conceptually simple


#### The frontier:

- First in, first out
- Pages at distance _n-1_ before those at distance _n_
- Thus: high initial relevance to seed
- Often optimized, revisit known pages

# Web structure and size

**Web graph**: the network of Web pages and hyperlinks

- Many (weakly) connected components
- Skewed size distribution

# Bow-tie structure

- **Giant strongly connected component**: every node is reachable from every other node

  ```
  
  [Source: wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component)
- **in-component**: those pages through which the GSCC can be reached
- **out-component**: those pages the GSCC can reach

# Topical locality
#### _Homophily_ in information networks
- the tendency of similar nodes to be connected
- "the capability to guess what a page is about by looking at the content of its neighbor pages"

--

#### Topical Locality: 

Likeliness that a target page within a given distance from the source is about the same topic as the source, related to this happening by chance (i.e. how general the topic is)

- Text similarity is a proxy for topical relatedness
  - calculated with co-occurrence of keywords (cosine similarity)
  
#### Topical locality is the relationship between the structure of the information networks and the content of the nodes


---
# Cosine similarity

- document _d_ as high-dimensionality vector: each term in the vocabulary has a weight _w_ in the vector
- weight typically corresponds to frequency of a term in the document
- compute the similarity between two documents by measuring the cosine between their vectors
- cosine close to 1: high similarity
- cosine close to 0: unrelated documents

### Exercises: in-degree and out-degree

1. Go to [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com) and search for publications on **network science**. Pick two papers from the search results:
1. What is the in-degree of the paper in the citation network?
1. What is the out-degree (i.e. number of papers citing them)?
