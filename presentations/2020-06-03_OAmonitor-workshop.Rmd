# Automating the monitoring

For standardized and rapid reporting:

# Start your project (step 1)

1. Open Rstudio

1. Go to: **File** > **New Project** > **New Directory** > **New Project**

1. Give your project a name, and place it inside an accessible folder on your computer.

1. Click 'Create Project'

![newproject](images/newproject.png)

_NB: no need to create a git repository or open in a new session._
---
# Start your project (step 2)

1. Open an R script: **File** > **New File** > **R Script**

1. Save it inside your project folder as `monitoring_script.R`

   You can now type R code in this script, and execute the code as follows:

  - Place your cursor in the line of code you want to execute

  - Press ![run](images/run.png) or ctrl + enter

  - When running multiple lines: select all lines, then press ‘Run’ or ctrl+enter
  
1. Give it a try! Type and execute the following line of code:
    ```{r first code}
    mean(1:10)
    ```


---
# Install the package

#### The following (probably) only needs to be done once...
... but you don't want to lose the code. So we will put it in the script.


1. Install the OA monitor from [its github repository](https://github.com/bvreede/OAmonitor):
```r
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/bvreede/OAmonitor")
```

1. enter '3' not to update any packages

--

#### When you are done, place a # in front of this line of code:
```{r}
# remotes::install_github("https://github.com/bvreede/OAmonitor")
```


---
# Load required libraries

Load the package (and some other libraries we will use)
```{r load libraries}
library(OAmonitor)
library(tidyverse)
```


---
# Input data

- Likely the export from a CRIS, or download from an online database (e.g. Scopus).

- May consist of multiple independent source files.

- Must be tabular, and can be either csv (comma or semicolon-separated), tsv (tab-separated), xlsx or xls.

- The workflow **requires** the following columns, which may or may not contain empty cells:

| Column | Explanation | Empty cells? |
|:---|:---|:---:|
|Unique ID | source-specific ID | No |
|Organization unit | e.g. departments, faculties (but can be anything) | No |
|ISSN | max 2 columns (e.g. ISSN + eISSN) | Yes |
|DOI | | Yes |

- Columns do not need to be renamed prior to use (but relevant columns do require a unique name)


---
# Prepare the input

1. [Download the excel template here](https://github.com/bvreede/OAmonitoring/blob/master/config/config_pub_files.xlsx).

1. Fill out the template:
  - Put each individual data file in a new column
  - Fill out the name of each relevant column per data file.

1. Place all source files in a subfolder of the project folder (e.g. `data/`).

1. Save the excel template inside the project folder.

For example:
![](images/input_excel.png)

---
# Load all data

- Your **configuration file** (filled out template) can be anywhere;
- Your **data files** are in a folder inside your project folder.

![folderstructure](images/folderstructure.png)

--

Using the configuration file, you will now load all data into a **combined data frame**.

```{r open everything, message=F}
df <- open_everything(file = "config_pub_files.xlsx",
                      dir = "data")
```
NB: `dir` is the folder where your data files are stored.

---
# Did it work?

```{r check data}
glimpse(df)
```


---
# Using external data

Data needed:
- VSNU (from an excel; provided)
- DOAJ (via API)
- Unpaywall (via API)

Running APIs takes a while (several hours), so the function contains the option to save, and then reload the data.

1. Prepare the following lines of code, but not run them yet;

1. Make sure that `save_results = T`, and fill out your own email address.

1. Then select **both** lines and run them. Keep your computer open while this runs.

```r
get_doaj(df, source = "api", save_results = T)

get_upw(df, source = "api", email = "YOUREMAIL@UNI.NL", save_results = T)
```
---
# Before part 2

- Please let us know if you have not yet received the VSNU data; we will send it to you.

- We recommend placing the VSNU excel file in the `data/` folder of your project.

- The DOAJ and UPW downloads will be placed in `data/clean/` (so it is useful if you already created the folder `data/`; if that does not exist, the program will create it for you).

- Confirm that the code has run: you will see a confirmation in your console, and you will see files show up in `data/clean/`.

- **If this does not happen**: please re-run the code (it will take a few hours), or get in touch with us.

## See you tomorrow!

# Did something go wrong? Not to worry!

The following code will download mock files to finish the workshop.

```r
dir.create("testdata/")

ghdir <- "https://github.com/bvreede/presentations/blob/master/presentations/mockdata/"
files <- c("mock_config.xlsx","mock_doaj.csv","mock_upw.csv", "mock_vsnu.xlsx", "mockdata_dighum_2018.csv","mockdata_nice_2018.tsv")

for(f in files){
  download.file(
    url = paste(ghdir, f, sep = ""),
    destfile = paste("testdata/", f, sep = ""),
    method = "curl")
}
```

To load, run the following code (and skip the next few slides, until the classification):

```r
df <- open_everything(file = "testdata/mock_config.xlsx",
                      dir = "testdata")
vsnudf <- get_vsnu("testdata/mock_vsnu.xlsx")
doajdf <- get_doaj(df, source="testdata/mock_doaj.csv")
upwdf <- get_upw(df, source="testdata/mock_upw.csv")
```

---

# Load existing data: VSNU data

1. Place the VSNU dataframe in your project (can be anywhere, but we recommend `data/`).

1. Load it with `get_vsnu()`. You will get warnings. This has to do with the file itself, and does not create problems for the workflow. You can safely ignore this.

```{r load vsnu data, message=F, warning=T, error=F}
vsnudf <- get_vsnu("data/VSNU-cummulatief_WOA20200302.xlsx")
```

---
# Load existing data: DOAJ and Unpaywall

1. You probably already have this data loaded, unless you restarted your Rstudio since yesterday.

1. Check your environment (top right window) for the presence of `doajdf` and `upwdf` (or whatever names you gave them yesterday).

1. **Only if you do not have these objects**, you can load them from the saved files:

```{r load classification data, message=F, warning=F, error=F}
doajdf <- get_doaj(df, source="data/doaj_from_issn_2020-03-09.csv")
upwdf <- get_upw(df, source="data/upw_from_doi_2020-03-09.csv")
```

NB: make sure to use the right path to where these files were saved in your system! Probably this is `data/clean/`. Obviously, make sure you use the right file names, too.

---
# Make the classification

```{r classify}
df_class <- classify_oa(df,
                        doajdf=doajdf,
                        vsnudf=vsnudf,
                        upwdf=upwdf,
                        max_year=2019)
```

Check the classification in your data:
```{r first results}
df_class %>% 
  group_by(OA_label,OA_label_explainer) %>% 
  summarise(papers = n())
```

---
# How it works

Uses information in a hierarchical way to arrive at a classification.

![classify_oa](images/classify_oa.png)

---
# Make a report
! The summary chart made earlier is **not** accurate, as papers may appear more than once (e.g. if they are classified under multiple faculties)

To perform deduplication, we need to make a report.

```{r report to dataframe}
report_to_dataframe(df_class)
```

---
# Make some images

```{r total bar chart}
report_to_image(df_class, type="total")
```
---
# Make some images

```{r proportional bar chart}
report_to_image(df_class, type="prop")
```

<!-- I have no idea why, but this function does not yield a result with "prop". This is what it should look like. -->
![](figures/plot_all_prop_2020-06-03.png)
---
# Make some images

```{r alluvial}
StatStratum <- ggalluvial::StatStratum # without this line you will get an error
report_to_alluvial(df_class)
```

---
# Make a full report

A full report includes:
- a summarizing table, reporting on percentages per organization unit
- a bar chart with total numbers
- a bar chart with proportional numbers
- an alluvial diagram for all papers (not deduplicated!)

All these are saved in `output/` or `figures/`.

Generate a full report like this:

```r
full_report(df_class)
```

---
# Custom report

[Download the template here.](https://github.com/bvreede/OAmonitoring/blob/master/config/reports.xlsx)

Make sub-groups of organization units that you want to include in a single report. For example:

![custom_report_elaborate](images/custom_report_elaborate.png)

Make all custom reports at once like this:

```{r subreport}
individual_reports(df_class, path_report = "subreports.xlsx")
```

Check the results in the folders `output/` and `figures/`

---
# Custom report

This is what it should look like:

.pull-left[
![faculty_science](figures/plot_All_faculties_prop_2020-06-03.png)
]
.pull-right[
![faculty_science](figures/alluvial_All_faculties_2020-06-03.png)
]

Question: is the alluvial diagram here informative? Why? Why not?

---
# Reporting on HOOP 

A different kind of sub-report: aggregating organization units, and reporting on the headers.

Deduplication is done per aggregate. This can be used e.g. for HOOP-areas.

[Download the template here.](https://github.com/bvreede/OAmonitoring/blob/master/config/HOOP_areas.xlsx)

![](images/hoop_input.png)

```{r report HOOP, warning=F, error=F, message=F}
hoop_report(df_class, path_hoop = "HOOP_areas.xlsx")
```

Output is once again saved in `output/` and `figures/`.

---
# Sufficient information?

```{r alluvial REBO}
df_class %>%
  filter(org_unit == "Faculteit REBO") %>%
  report_to_alluvial(title = "REBO")
```

"NONE" means that either:
- There was no DOI associated to 

---
# Adding custom labels

Sometimes, 

[Download the template here.](https://github.com/bvreede/OAmonitoring/blob/master/data/custom_labels.xlsx)

We make an excel with labels, listing the unique IDs of papers:

![custom_labels](images/custom_labels.png)
---

# Re-classifying the data

When applying the classification function, we now include the custom data:

```{r}
df_class_custom <- classify_oa(df,
                        doajdf=doajdf,
                        vsnudf=vsnudf,
                        upwdf=upwdf,
                        max_year=2019,
                        custom=T,
                        custom_path="data/custom_labels.xlsx")


df_class_custom %>% 
  group_by(OA_label,OA_label_explainer) %>% 
  summarise(papers = n())
```


--- 
# What organization units have insufficient information?
